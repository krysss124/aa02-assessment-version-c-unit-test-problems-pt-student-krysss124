/*******************************************************************************

You work at a grocery store, and items over $10 are getting a 20% discount.
Write a function that takes in an array of grocery items and returns an array
of grocery items that qualify for the sale. Include their new sale price.

Example:

groceryItems = [
  {name: "eggs", price: 6},
  {name: "bread", price: 5},
  {name: "milk", price: 4},
  {name: "walnuts", price: 15}
];
console.log(applySale(groceryItems)); // [ {name: "walnuts", price: 12} ]

*******************************************************************************/

/* 
Test Specs:
applySale() 
5) should return items that are prcied more than $10 with a 20% discount
6) should not give a discount to items less than or equal to $10
*/

// Your code here 
function applySale(items) {
  
}
